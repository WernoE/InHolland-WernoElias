            <h2>Solar Panels</h2>
            <p>A solar panel is actually a collection of solar (or photovoltaic) cells, which can be used to generate electricity through photovoltaic effect. These cells are arranged in a grid-like pattern on the surface of solar panels. Installation of solar panels in homes helps in combating the harmful emissions of greenhouse gases and thus helps reduce global warming. Solar panels do not lead to any form of pollution and are clean. They also decrease our reliance on fossil fuels (which are limited) and traditional power sources.</p>

            <h2>Charge Controller</h2>
             <p>A solar charge controller manages the power going into the battery bank from the solar array.  It ensures that the deep cycle batteries are not overcharged during the day, and that the power doesnâ€™t run backwards to the solar panels overnight and drain the batteries. Some charge controllers are available with additional capabilities, like lighting and load control, but managing the power is its primary job.
             A solar charge controller is available in two different technologies, PWM and MPPT. How they perform in a system is very different from each other. An MPPT charge controller is more expensive than a PWM charge controller, and it is often worth it to pay the extra money.</p>

            <h2>Battery System</h2>
            <p>A battery management system (BMS) is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery (cell or battery pack), such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating area[clarification needed], monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data, controlling its environment, authenticating it and / or balancing it.[1]
            A battery pack built together with a battery management system with an external communication data bus is a smart battery pack. A smart battery pack must be charged by a smart battery charger.</p>

        <article class="article4solar">
            <h2>DC Power</h2>
            <p>Direct current (DC) is the one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.</p>

        <article class="article5solar">
            <h2>Inverter</h2>
            <p>An inverter converts the DC voltage to an AC voltage. In most cases, the input DC voltage is usually lower while the output AC is equal to the grid supply voltage of either 120 volts, or 240 Volts depending on the country.
            The inverter may be built as standalone equipment for applications such as solar power, or to work as a backup power supply from batteries which are charged separately.
            The other configuration is when it is a part of a bigger circuit such as a power supply unit, or a UPS. In this case, the inverter input DC is from the rectified mains AC in the PSU, while from either the rectified AC in the in the UPS when there is power, and from the batteries whenever there is a power failure.</p>

        <article class="article6solar">
            <h2>AC</h2>
            <p>Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct, as when they modify current or voltage.</p>
